Answer: vgg and alexnet produced the same output but vgg model took 3s to perform the classification while alexnet took 0s. Resnet misclassified a water bottle as a water jug. Hence, taking into consideration the execution time and the results of the classification, alexnet will be my model of choice. It is fast and the results were as expected.
